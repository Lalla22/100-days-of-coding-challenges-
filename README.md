# 100 Days of Coding Challenge - Lalla Sankara 
A repository to track my daily coding progress as part of my commitment to 100 Days of Coding Challenge. Following my coding journey to enhance my skills, work on projects, and stay consistent in my coding practice.

## ðŸŽ¯ Challenge Objective
Welcome to my 100 Days of Coding Challenge repository! The goal is simple: dedicate a portion of your day to learning and coding for the next 100 days. Here, I'll be documenting my coding journey over the next 100 days as I work on various coding projects and exercises to improve my skills. The goal of this challenge is to stay consistent in my coding practice and make meaningful progress. Most of time, I'll be coding in python and java script for problem solving. Going from beginner to advance level. 

## ðŸ“– How to Approach This Challenge
1. **Understand the Topic:** Begin each day by learning the concept or topic assigned for that day. 
2. **Code Daily:** Apply what you've learned by coding. The real understanding comes from doing. 
3. **Review and Reflect:** End your day by reviewing what you've learned and reflect on how you can use it in real-world scenarios. 
4. **Stay Consistent:** Consistency is key. Make learning a habit, and you'll see progress.
5. **Topics:** Will be reviewing basics, data sturutures, and machine learning. 

## Day-by-Day Progress
I will maintain a daily log of my activities, coding projects, and what I've learned. 

## Project Showcase
I'll showcase some of the projects I'm working on throughout this challenge.
